<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a PhD student at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), starting from Fall 2024. I am honored to be supervised by Professor [Yuyu Luo](https://luoyuyu.vip/). Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the [School of Information](http://info.ruc.edu.cn/), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/). My research interest primarily focuses on LLM Based Agents, with a particular emphasis on reasoning ablity and the paradigm of constructing agents that are adaptable to multiple environments. 

I am building a community called [MindForge](https://github.com/Mind4Forge), aimed at bringing together researchers and engineers interested in intelligence to explore autonomous and efficient agents across different environments. ***If you are interested, feel free to reach out to me***.

You can find my CV here: [didi's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV.pdf).

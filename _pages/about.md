<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am a PhD student at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), starting from Fall 2024. I am honored to be supervised by Professor [Yuyu Luo](https://luoyuyu.vip/). Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the [School of Information](http://info.ruc.edu.cn/), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/). My research interest primarily focuses on LLM Based Agents, with a particular emphasis on reasoning ablity and the paradigm of constructing agents that are adaptable to multiple environments. 

You can find my CV here: [didi's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Jiayi Zhang CV.pdf).

[AFlow: Automating Agentic Workflow Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10762)

**Jiayi Zhang**, Jinyu Xiang, Zhaoyang Yu, Fengwei Teng, Xionghui Chen, Jiaqi Chen, Mingchen Zhuge, Xin Cheng, Sirui Hong, Jinlin Wang, Bingnan Zheng, Bang Liu, Yuyu Luo, Chenglin Wu

We introduces AFlow, an automated framework that reformulates workflow optimization as a search problem over code-represented workflows, using Monte Carlo Tree Search to efficiently explore and refine workflows through code modification and execution feedback. By leveraging this approach, AFlow achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, while also enabling smaller models to outperform larger ones at a fraction of the cost.

[MobileExperts: A Dynamic Tool-Enabled Agent Team in Mobile Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03913)

**Jiayi Zhang**, Chuang Zhao, Yihan Zhao, Zhaoyang Yu, Ming He, Jianping Fan

We introduces MobileExperts, a novel system that advances autonomous operations in mobile computing through multi-agent collaboration and tool formulation. It addresses the limitations of current Visual Language Models in handling complex tasks on mobile devices. The study demonstrates improved performance across various complexity levels and significantly reduced reasoning costs, marking a step forward in mobile device automation.

[DATA INTERPRETER: AN LLM AGENT FOR DATA SCIENCE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18679)

MetaGPT Community

We introduces the Data Interpreter, an advanced LLM-based agent designed to enhance problem-solving in data science. It employs three key techniques: dynamic planning with hierarchical graphs, dynamic tool integration, and logical inconsistency identification. The Data Interpreter outperforms existing open-source solutions in various data science and real-world tasks, showing significant improvements in machine learning, mathematical problem-solving, and open-ended tasks.
